# ATS Test ESP32 Demo

> **ESP32 ATS Test Runner - Hardware test execution framework**

This repository contains the automated test execution framework for validating ESP32 firmware using real hardware as part of the ATS (Automation Test System) platform.

It is designed to run on ATS nodes (Raspberry Pi / Mini PC) and focuses on execution, observation, and validation, not firmware building.

**This repository is intentionally decoupled from firmware source code.**

## ✅ What This Repository Is Responsible For

- ✅ Flashing ESP32 firmware artifacts produced by CI
- ✅ Executing automated hardware tests
- ✅ Observing firmware behavior via:
  - UART logs
  - GPIO state
  - Visual indicators (LED / OLED)
- ✅ Producing test reports and metrics
- ✅ Integrating with Jenkins-based test pipelines

---

## ❌ What This Repository Does NOT Do

- ❌ Build firmware
- ❌ Modify firmware source code
- ❌ Manage CI orchestration
- ❌ Own artifact generation

**Those responsibilities belong to:**

- `ats-fw-esp32-demo` (firmware)
- `ats-ci-infra` (CI orchestration)

---

## 🏗️ Intended Execution Environment

This test runner is expected to run inside a Docker container on ATS nodes.

**Typical ATS node setup:**

- Raspberry Pi / Mini PC
- Docker Engine
- Jenkins agent (SSH / inbound)

**All test logic runs inside the container, not on the host OS.**

---

## 🔄 High-Level Test Flow

1. **Jenkins test pipeline schedules a test job**
2. **The test job:**
   - Pulls firmware artifact (`firmware.bin`)
   - Pulls execution manifest (`ats-manifest.yaml`)
3. **The test runner:**
   - Flashes firmware to ESP32
   - Reboots the device
   - Observes runtime behavior
4. **Test results are collected as:**
   - Logs
   - Pass/Fail status
   - Metrics
5. **Results are archived and reported back to CI**

---

## 📋 Manifest-Driven Execution

Test execution is driven by a manifest generated during the firmware build pipeline.

**Example fields consumed:**

- Firmware artifact name
- Commit hash
- Test plan
- Target device

**This allows:**

- Full traceability
- Reproducible test runs
- Clean separation between build and test

---

## 🧪 Supported Test Types (Initial)

- UART boot validation
- GPIO / LED behavior
- Firmware stability (reboot / timing)
- Visual validation (optional, future)

---

## 🔗 Relationship to Other Repositories

- **Firmware source:** `ats-fw-esp32-demo`
- **CI infrastructure:** `ats-ci-infra`
- **Platform documentation:** `ats-platform-docs`
- **Hardware access tools:** `ats-ats-node`

---

## 📊 Project Status

This repository is under active development and serves as:

- A reference implementation
- A base for scaling ATS test nodes
- A foundation for future test farm automation
